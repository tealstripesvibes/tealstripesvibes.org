    # In 2022 I was fired twice.

    Both times I was hired by a team.

    Both times I was fired by a manager.

    ## Reasons

    One manager said to practice speaking to lower IQ audiences, so I practiced teaching HTML and CSS to new developers.

    One manager felt my work lacked visibility, so I practiced documenting my work in video form.

    ## Abstract Thinking

    I've been told that my thoughts sound abstract by a few people,
    and that's understandable,
    though it's been challenging for me to find a generalizable solution to this problem.

    As a Software Engineer, I've practiced navigating abstraction fluently,
    so it doesn't bother me to speak concretely about topics that only exist in conceptual space.

    Towards understanding, this has been *phenomenal* in helping me understand a problem intuitively and quickly.

    The challenge comes in communicating this understanding clearly and concisely on teams without buy-in.

    On teams with buy-in, the occasion for scrutiny doesn't come up as often.
    Conversations focus on the elements that can be mutually understood, and the matters of expertise are left as exercises for the participants.

    On teams that lack mutual trust, it can be awkward to guess at the level of detail that will be understood by the other party.
    Without trust, it's less likely that occasions will naturally emerge that clarify understanding.

    I've spent my time since 2022 documenting my abilities and practicing translating complex ideas into simple shapes.

    ## Moving Forward

    A lot has changed in the space of technology recently, and I've mostly been focused on bridging literacy gaps in response.

    The ability to navigate and fluently communicate with structured language defines a new stratification of access when the scale of grounded understanding now exists with AI as the floor.

    I've continued developing, and my TikTok has a history of what spwashi.com has looked like.

    My YouTube channel describes the pace of development, and my relationships with 8 clients have given me strong examples of collaboration that I can describe.

    I've successfully deployed 30 websites since 2022, and I have a momentum that's been described across dimensions.

    Now I'm ready to move forward.

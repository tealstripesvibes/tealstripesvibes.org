The

easiest

3
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:03,251
way

4
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:03,401
that

5
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:03,618
I can

6
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:04,251
describe

7
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:04,368
the

8
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:04,718
frame

9
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:04,902
that I

10
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:05,019
have

11
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:05,569
adopted

12
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:05,769
over

13
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:05,919
the

14
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:06,319
course

15
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,069
of my

16
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:07,686
development

17
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:08,987
career

18
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:10,338
is

19
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:11,472
obvious.

20
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:11,805
It

21
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:12,639
feels obvious

22
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,723
to say

23
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:14,023
that

24
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:14,406
it was

25
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:15,440
impossible

26
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:15,974
to

27
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:16,357
solve

28
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:16,941
the problem

29
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:17,158
that I

30
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:17,474
tried

31
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:17,558
to

32
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:18,308
solve,

33
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:18,758
but I

34
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:19,058
tried

35
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:19,175
to

36
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:19,625
solve it

37
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:19,842
in

38
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:20,142
pretty

39
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:20,476
unique

40
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:21,410
ways.

41
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:21,976
So

42
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:22,660
that is

43
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,260
the reason

44
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,511
why

45
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:23,627
the

46
00:00:23,627 --> 00:00:24,077
skills

47
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:24,228
that

48
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:24,794
I've

49
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:26,095
developed

50
00:00:26,228 --> 00:00:26,479
have

51
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,646
developed

52
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:28,946
and

53
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,713
just

54
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,547
summarizing

55
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:30,947
the goal

56
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,097
that

57
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,398
I had,

58
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:32,798
I was

59
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:33,132
trying

60
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:33,615
to

61
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:34,399
communicate

62
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:34,632
my

63
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:35,466
emotions

64
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:35,900
using

65
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,200
software

66
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:38,534
without

67
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:39,735
realizing

68
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:40,752
that

69
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:41,119
putting

70
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,319
them

71
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:41,619
into

72
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:41,769
the

73
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:42,319
frame

74
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:42,486
of

75
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:43,487
software

76
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:43,870
wasn't

77
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,387
relatable

78
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:44,537
to

79
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:45,838
a lot of people.

80
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:46,271
So

81
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:46,671
something

82
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:46,838
that

83
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,138
felt

84
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:47,355
like

85
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:47,622
it was

86
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:48,339
clarifying

87
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,206
to me

88
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:49,423
was

89
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:49,906
actually

90
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:50,657
alienating

91
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:50,990
to

92
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,257
a lot

93
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:51,340
of

94
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,590
other

95
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,457
people.

96
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:52,641
And

97
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,174
then

98
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:53,441
in the

99
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:53,808
course

100
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:54,142
of

101
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:54,558
trying

102
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:54,675
to

103
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:55,976
understand,

104
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:56,559
like

105
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:56,860
what

106
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,160
kind

107
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,793
of software

108
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:58,060
can I

109
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,810
write

110
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,211
that

111
00:00:59,211 --> 00:00:59,444
can

112
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:00,111
describe

113
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:00,261
to

114
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:00,611
people

115
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:00,861
why

116
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:01,362
they

117
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:01,662
should

118
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,112
not be

119
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:02,712
alienated

120
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:03,012
by

121
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:04,030
software?

122
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,963
I eventually

123
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:05,480
discovered

124
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,647
that

125
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:06,547
mathematically,

126
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:07,931
even

127
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:08,348
according

128
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:08,532
to the

129
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:08,949
framework

130
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:09,132
that I

131
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:09,282
was

132
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,249
adopting,

133
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:10,566
the goal

134
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:10,716
that

135
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:11,383
I had

136
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:11,750
couldn't

137
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,900
be

138
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,201
achieved

139
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:13,551
with

140
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,084
the channels

141
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:14,318
that I

142
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:14,451
was

143
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:14,768
using

144
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:15,018
to

145
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:15,368
approach

146
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:16,235
it.

147
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:16,485
And

148
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:17,019
since

149
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:17,619
I found

150
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,770
that

151
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,087
it is

152
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:19,637
easier

153
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:19,870
to

154
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,387
communicate

155
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:20,537
with

156
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:20,887
people

157
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:21,971
who wanted

158
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:22,305
to

159
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:23,605
communicate,

160
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,339
it is easier

161
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:24,456
to

162
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:24,739
find

163
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:25,056
common

164
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:25,490
ground

165
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,640
with

166
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:25,940
people

167
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,774
who understand

168
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:26,957
that

169
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:27,140
there

170
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,257
is

171
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:27,607
common

172
00:01:27,607 --> 00:01:28,008
ground

173
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:28,358
to be

174
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:29,208
found,

175
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:29,925
etc.

176
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:30,309
and

177
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:30,675
some of

178
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:30,792
the

179
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:31,009
other

180
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:31,242
stuff

181
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:31,459
that I

182
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:31,609
can

183
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:31,809
say

184
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:32,026
about

185
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:32,926
communication

186
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,710
sounds

187
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,011
obvious.

188
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:35,761
Everything

189
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,011
you can

190
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:36,228
say

191
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:36,461
about

192
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:37,395
communication

193
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:37,879
sounds

194
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,779
obvious,

195
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:38,863
and

196
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:38,946
the

197
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:39,313
reasons

198
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:39,396
that

199
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:39,830
it doesn't

200
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,880
work

201
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,447
are

202
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:41,981
simply

203
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:42,548
sometimes

204
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:42,698
that

205
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:42,798
it

206
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:42,998
just

207
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:43,298
doesn't

208
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:44,599
work.

209
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:46,600
but

210
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,417
what you can do

211
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:47,900
is be

212
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,667
optimistic

213
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,968
and

214
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:50,868
understand

215
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:51,368
the energy

216
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:51,485
that

217
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:51,635
you

218
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:52,035
have

219
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:52,236
for

220
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:52,786
the channels

221
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:52,903
that

222
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:53,019
you

223
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:53,169
have

224
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:53,586
access

225
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:54,437
to,

226
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:54,820
and

227
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,220
place

228
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,904
your energy

229
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,138
in the

230
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:57,788
spaces

231
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:58,005
in the

232
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:58,388
ways

233
00:01:58,388 --> 00:01:58,689
that

234
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:00,223
bring

235
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:00,606
harmony

236
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:00,823
to the

237
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:02,124
world.

238
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:03,491
So

239
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:03,708
without

240
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,008
further

241
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:04,425
ado,

242
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:04,641
the

243
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,225
projects.

244
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:05,508
This

245
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:05,892

shift.

250
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:09,577
There are

251
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:09,827
a lot

252
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:09,977
more

253
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:10,661
repositories.

254
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:10,878
I think

255
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:10,961
that

256
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:11,144
I have

257
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:11,411

261
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:14,696
but

262
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:15,096
these

263
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:15,163
are

264
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:15,230

266
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:16,397
ones

267
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:16,997
that I

268
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:17,481
think

269
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:18,348
communicate

272
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:19,365
and

273
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:20,666
intent.

274
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:21,099
Eight

275
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,883
years ago

276
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:22,116
I was

277
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:22,416
working

278
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:22,516
on

279
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:22,566
a

280
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,050

Shift.

284
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:25,368
The idea

285
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:25,718
was to

286
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:26,001
make

287
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:26,868

288
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:27,185

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,020
being

292
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,203
a

293
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:29,653

Notes.

301
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:33,905
The thing

302
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:34,239
that I

303
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:34,722
noticed

304
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:34,956
about

305
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:35,773

306
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:36,140
or

307
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,406
some of

308
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:36,673
these

309
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:36,940
very

310
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,273
helpful

311
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,557
resources,

312
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:39,008
was

313
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,091
that I

314
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:40,308
didn't

315
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:40,492
like

316
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:40,992
the design

317
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,525
of them.

318
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:41,959
I thought

319
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:42,526
they

320
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:42,976
weren't

321
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:44,277
very clear

322
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:44,744
or

323
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:45,310
the content

324
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,027
was useful.

325
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:46,511
I just

326
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:47,812
didn't

327
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:48,279
like

328
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:48,996
how I

329
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:49,429
wasn't

330
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:50,146
interactive.

331
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:50,530
I wanted

332
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:50,630
to

333
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,863
bring it

334
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:51,047
into

335
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:51,397
my own

336
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,214
world.

337
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:52,431
And

338
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:52,881
since

339
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,714
I found

340
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:54,015
that

341
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:54,531
I wanted

342
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:54,915
to be

343
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:55,148
able

344
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:55,865
to

345
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:56,616
fluently

346
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:57,099
use

347
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:57,500
HTML

348
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,667
and CSS,

349
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,300
but

350
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,684
I wanted

351
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:00,251
a website

352
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,101
that

353
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:01,601
brought me

354
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:01,785
that

355
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,086
experience,

356
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:03,286
it

357
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:03,819
said,

358
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,103
here

359
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:04,153
are

360
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:04,536
the things

361
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:04,670
that

362
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,786
you're

363
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,320
learning,

364
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,870
and

365
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,104
they're

366
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:06,771
represented

367
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:07,971
in the style

368
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:08,238
that

369
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:09,072
specifically

370
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:09,305
you're

371
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:09,822
interested

372
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:10,055
in.

373
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:11,923
So

374
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:12,073
that

375
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:12,190
was

376
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,440
kind

377
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,673
of the

378
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:12,940
idea

379
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,057
that

380
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,357
I had.

381
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,591
and

382
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:16,175
the focus

383
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:16,575
that I

384
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:16,875
had

385
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,075
while

386
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:17,292
I was

387
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:17,376
in

388
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,826
college

389
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:18,009
was

390
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:18,276
working

391
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:18,343
on

392
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:18,409
a

393
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:18,710

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,326
organization

395
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:19,577
called

396
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:19,927
Student

397
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:20,360
Body

398
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,477
for

399
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:20,894
Meaningful

400
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,194
Education.

401
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:22,928
The idea

402
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:23,062
with

403
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:23,345
that

404
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:23,645
was

405
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:23,862

406
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:24,312
students

407
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:25,296

00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:25,946
enter,

409
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:26,046
they

410
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:26,180

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:26,830
go.

414
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,830
They could

415
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,097
have

416
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:28,931

discussions.

419
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:30,015
They could

420
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:30,582
participate

421
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:30,648

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:33,767
why

430
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:33,917
their

431
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:34,450
education

432
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:34,567
was

433
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,017
structured

434
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:35,351
the way that

435
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:35,451
it

436
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:36,751
was.

437
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,152
And

438
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:38,619
that

439
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:38,986
paired

440
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:39,319
pretty

441
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,553
well

442
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:39,769
with

443
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,003
this

444
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:40,336
fact

445
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:40,636
shift

446
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:41,587
idea,

447
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:41,804
which

448
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,104
was to

449
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:43,671
kind

450
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:43,905
of be

451
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:44,705
the software

452
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:45,305
behind

453
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:45,639

organization.

456
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:47,807
And so

457
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:48,290
I continued

458
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:48,407
to

459
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:48,824
explore

460
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:49,874
that

461
00:03:49,874 --> 00:03:50,141
and

462
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,391
wrote

463
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:50,541

00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,927
framework.

473
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:56,711
That was a

481
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:01,146
the deep

482
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:01,546
dive

483
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:01,780
that I

484
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,080
did in

485
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:03,697

490
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:05,765
rewrote

491
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:06,048

496
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:07,899
times.

497
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,067
And

498
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:10,300
there

499
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,551
is

500
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,117

I'm

506
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:13,669
sure

507
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:13,819
this

508
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:14,436
was

509
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,703
authentication

510
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:17,004
authorization.

511
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:18,288
What is

512
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:18,888
security

513
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:19,421

514
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,105
As

515
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,406
I see.

516
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:21,756
And

517
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:22,006
then

518
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,307
I think

519
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:24,307
a zoom

520
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,608

521
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:28,125
I

522
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:28,276
don't

523
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:28,609
remember

524
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:28,759
where

525
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:28,926
this

00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:29,710
got,

528
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,043
quite

529
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,327
honestly,

530
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:32,411
but

531
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:32,528
I

532
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:32,978
continued

533
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:33,311
working

534
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:33,578
on it

535
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:34,478
and

536
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,229
developed it

537
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:35,596
into

538
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:35,862

543
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:40,381
counterpart.

544
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,032
This is

just

548
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:41,615
like

549
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:41,865

553
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:44,767
These are

554
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:45,133
the ways

555
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:45,350
that I

556
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,550
think

557
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:45,800
about

business.

559
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,501
This is me

560
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:47,835
starting

561
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:47,918

562
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,219
contextualize.

563
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:51,220
How

566
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,354
might

567
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,188
look.

568
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:54,555
Before

00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:54,621
I

570
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:55,038
actually

571
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:55,272
got

578
00:04:59,057 --> 00:04:59,390
because

579
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,440
I

580
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,590
wrote

00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:13,447
maintained

610
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,264

611
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,564

624
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:20,317
rounds

625
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:20,767

other positions.

632
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:26,269
So

633
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:26,536
this was

634
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:26,770

642
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:31,639
an experience

643
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:31,789
that

644
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:31,939
I've

645
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:32,556
had

646
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:32,706
and a

647
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:32,989
place

648
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:33,189
that I

649
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,523
stayed

650
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:33,673
for

651
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:33,856
two

652
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,157
years.

653
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:37,992
Soup

654
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,226
JS

655
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:39,559
I was

656
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:39,876
working

657
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:40,576
on

658
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:41,143
a few years

659
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:41,527
ago,

660
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:41,677
and

661
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:42,194
this was

662
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:42,460
me

663
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,827
starting

664
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:43,011
to

665
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:43,878
formalize

666
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:44,078
the

667
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:44,595
design

668
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,278
concept

669
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:45,462
that

670
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,446
I had

671
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:46,662
because

672
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:46,729
I

673
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:47,413
recognized

674
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:47,563
that

675
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:47,746
there

676
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:47,796
are

677
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:47,980
a lot

678
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,046
of

679
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:48,730
similarities

680
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,130
between

681
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,214
the

682
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:49,514
things

683
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:49,730
that I

684
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,481
explored

685
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:50,648
in

686
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:51,164
college

687
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:51,398
with

688
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:51,998
design,

689
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:52,182
and

690
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,466
then,

691
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:53,716
in

692
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:54,249
research

693
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:54,616
with

694
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:54,816
the

698
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,500
where

699
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,750
I was

700
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,101
working

701
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:57,367
on

702
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:58,668
and,

703
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,919
it was helping

704
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:01,069
with

705
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,903
research

706
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,203
into

00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:02,737
adult

708
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,037
cognition,

709
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:04,988
exploring

710
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:06,172
about

711
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:06,605
whether

712
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:06,905

713
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:07,272

games

715
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:08,022
or

716
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:08,389
reading

717
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,690
books

718
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,057
had

719
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:10,640
specific

720
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,107
effects

721
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,141
on

722
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,608
cognitive

723
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:13,208
function

724
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:13,508
over

725
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,659
time.

726
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:14,809
And

727
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:14,926
that

728
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:15,109
kind

729
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:15,192
of

730
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:15,342
just

731
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:15,609
got me

732
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,910
thinking.

733
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:17,260
so

734
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,110
I formalized it

735
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,377
into

736
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,211
this

737
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:19,728
language

738
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:19,995
called

739
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:20,412
soup.

740
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:22,696
and I

741
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:22,879
thought

742
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,947
about

743
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:24,163
how

744
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:24,280
you

745
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,430
could

746
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:24,997
simplify

747
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:26,031
it and

748
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:26,348
make it

749
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:26,715
something

750
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:26,798
that

751
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:26,865
you

752
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:26,981
could

753
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:27,348
debug

754
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:27,532
in the

755
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:28,815
browser.

756
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:30,316
And

757
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:30,500
I was

758
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,967
using

759
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:31,250
this

760
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,817
parser

761
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:32,451
expression

762
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,351
grammar

763
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,035
library

764
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:34,702
called

765
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:35,135
peg,

766
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:35,769
JS or

767
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:36,136
PEGI,

768
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:36,436
I think

769
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:36,552
it's

770
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:36,786
called

771
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:38,087
now.

772
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:38,720
And

773
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,037
that was

774
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:40,154
good

775
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:40,388
to

776
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:41,622
an extent.

777
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:42,005
I ran

778
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:42,672
into

779
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:42,905
an

780
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:43,339
issue

781
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:43,489
where

782
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:43,806
there are

783
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:44,139
some

784
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:44,856
nuanced

785
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:45,223
things

786
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:45,440
that I

787
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,707
wanted

788
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:46,007
to do

789
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:46,124
with

790
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:46,207
the

791
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,091
language,

792
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:47,241
with

793
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:47,741
debugging

794
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,258
it,

795
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:48,675
stepping

796
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:48,892
through

797
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:49,542
it,

798
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:49,992
and

799
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,326
really

800
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:50,526
being

801
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:50,742
able

802
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:50,859
to

803
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:51,376
represent

804
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:51,860
each

805
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,660
symbol,

806
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:52,994
each

807
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,044
frame

808
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:54,911
as

809
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:55,161
like

810
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:55,578
literally

811
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:55,628
a

812
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:56,929
painting,

813
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:57,312
because

814
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:57,679
I wanted

815
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:57,946
to

816
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:58,213
make

817
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:58,363
this

818
00:06:58,363 --> 00:06:58,813
tangible

819
00:06:58,813 --> 00:06:58,880
to

820
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,046
other

821
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:00,347
people.

822
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:01,881
And I

823
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:02,348
found

824
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:02,631
that

825
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,315
I couldn't

826
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:03,882
quite

827
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,249
do

828
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,166
that

829
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:05,900
with

830
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,366
this

831
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:06,817
parser.

832
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:07,400
Expression

833
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,701
grammar.

834
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:10,368
It was

835
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:10,785
useful

836
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:10,935
for

837
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:11,586
prototyping

838
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:11,686
the

839
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:12,253
language

840
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:12,486
and

841
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:12,853
saying,

842
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:13,153
these are

843
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:13,236
the

844
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:13,570
kinds

845
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:13,987
of shapes

846
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:14,120
that

847
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,387
I want

848
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:14,954
to

849
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:15,621
get out,

850
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,905
but

851
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:17,272
I

852
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:17,705
think

853
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,155
soup

854
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:18,489
is a

855
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:19,089
different

856
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,390
it

857
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,623
has a

858
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:21,107
different

859
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,241
goal.

860
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:22,574
Soup

861
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:22,691
is

862
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:23,241
a lot

863
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:23,658
closer

864
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:23,775
to

865
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:24,141
natural

866
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:24,608
language

867
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:24,758
than

868
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:25,025
I thought

869
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:25,359
it was

870
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:25,425
to

871
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:25,726
begin

872
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:26,509
with.

873
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:27,560
And

874
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:27,676
the

875
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:28,127
software

876
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:28,310
that I

877
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:28,427
was

878
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:29,727
using

879
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,428
was,

880
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:33,162
better

881
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:33,996
for I

882
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:34,213
see

883
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:35,513
pages.

884
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:36,464
The parser

885
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:36,547
that

886
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:36,764
I was

887
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:37,031
using

888
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:37,331
was

889
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:37,698
better

890
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:38,998
for.

891
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:42,500
Who

892
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:42,917
how should I

893
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,218
say it

894
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:45,502
better

895
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:45,768
for

896
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:46,085
more

897
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,386
structured,

898
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,020
computer

899
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,737
languages?

900
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:50,887
I

901
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,188
would say

902
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:53,022
I would

903
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:53,405
recommend

904
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:53,505
it,

905
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:53,739
though,

906
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:53,955
for

907
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:54,222
people

908
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:54,306
who

909
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:54,406
are

910
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:54,606
getting

911
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:54,906
into

912
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:55,339
writing

913
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:55,840
programing

914
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,140
languages.

915
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:58,308
But

916
00:07:58,308 --> 00:07:58,724
eventually

917
00:07:58,724 --> 00:07:58,808
I

918
00:07:58,808 --> 00:07:59,208
hand-rolled

919
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,075
my own parser

920
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:00,258
and

921
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,559
this is

922
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:02,143
the

923
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:02,710

924
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,043
on

925
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:03,793
npm,

926
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:04,394
the package

927
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:04,610
on

928
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,911
npm,

929
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:06,912
last

931
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:07,595
two

932
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:07,845
years

933
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,013
ago,

934
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:09,429
and

935
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:09,613
it's

936
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:10,913
simplified

937
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:12,197
not

938
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:12,548
as many

939
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:13,848
constructs.

940
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:14,715
I

941
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:14,899
don't

942
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:15,049
go

943
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:15,316
into

944
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:15,499
as

945
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:15,699
much

946
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:16,099
detail

947
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:16,299
in

948
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:16,599
this

949
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,083
particular

950
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,384
Readme.

951
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:19,417
Let's

952
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,718
see.

953
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,770
Yeah,

954
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:26,654
and I

955
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:27,038
actually

956
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,338
implemented

957
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:28,939
this

958
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:29,355
in the

959
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,523
d3 v7

960
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:31,190
package,

961
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:31,757
which is

962
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:32,257
actually

963
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:32,390
the

964
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:32,657
code

965
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:32,924
base

966
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:33,091

967
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:34,391
effective.com.

968
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:44,479
So

969
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:44,646
here

970
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:45,947
we see

971
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,030
that

972
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,564
we can

973
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:47,897
turn

974
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:48,048
these

975
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:48,248
into

976
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:48,765
phrases.

977
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:49,098
And

978
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:49,365
there are

979
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,049
some

980
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,349
specific

981
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:52,416
quirks

982
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:52,666
about

983
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,900
it.

984
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,134
Like

985
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:54,367
do

986
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,668
something.

987
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:00,920
This is

988
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,087
hard

989
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:01,220
to

990
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,871
explain.

991
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:02,288
It's

992
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:02,838
cognitive

993
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:03,438
psychology

994
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:04,739
stuff.

995
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:05,622
Eventually

996
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:05,856
you would

997
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:06,139
learn

998
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:06,289
what

999
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:06,490
this

1000
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,040
means

1001
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,423
and

1002
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:07,573
be

1003
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:07,790
able

1004
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:07,907
to

1005
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:08,324
interact

1006
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:08,474
with

1007
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:08,657
this

1008
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:09,224
fluently

1009
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:10,008
and

1010
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:10,642
associate

1011
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:10,758
your

1012
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,025
thoughts

1013
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:11,142
of

1014
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:11,775
physics

1015
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:12,726
and

1016
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,093
so on

1017
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:13,359
and so

1018
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,026
forth.

1019
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:14,260
But

1020
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,410
that

1021
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:14,593
gets

1022
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:14,777
into

1023
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:16,077
the

1024

where

1025
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:17,812
I ended

1026
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:18,378
up

1027
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,679
after,

1028
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:20,346
let's

1029
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:20,646
say,

1030
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:20,863
eight

1031
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:21,280

1035
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:24,331
into language

1036
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:24,698
and

1037
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,298
what it means

1038
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:25,415
to

1039
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:25,665
write

1043

Shift,

1044
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,184

00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,007
back

1067
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:43,123
end

1068
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,424
structure.

1069
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:44,691
And

1070
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:44,891
then

1071
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:45,641
SMGs

1072
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:46,508
is

1073
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:47,375
understanding

1074
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:47,742
that

1075
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:48,343
somehow

1076
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:48,493
these

1077
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:49,093
structures

1078
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:49,243
need

1079
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:49,326
to

1080
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:49,510
come

1081
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:49,693
from

1082
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:50,060
the back

1083
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,293
end

1084
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:51,577
to the front end.

1085
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:51,878
So

1086
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:52,128
you need

1087
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:52,311
to be

1088
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:52,478
able

1089
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:52,611
to

1090
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:53,262
communicate

1091
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:53,895
the

1092
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:54,529
abstract

1093
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,479
structures

1094
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:55,963
formally

1095
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:56,596
enough

1096
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:56,797
so

1097
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:57,013
that a

1098
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,497
different

1099
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:57,797
team

1100
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:57,980
can

1101
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,397
interact

1102
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,181
with them.

1103
00:09:59,181 --> 00:09:59,348
Then

1104
00:09:59,348 --> 00:09:59,648
I thought

1105
00:09:59,648 --> 00:09:59,898
about

1106
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:00,165
that

1107
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:00,315
as

1108
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:00,999
I had

1109
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:01,866
experiences

1110
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:02,166
working

1111
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:02,316
on

1112
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:02,466
this

1113
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:02,683
team

1114
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:02,833
for

1115
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,066
two

1116
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:03,917
years

1117
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:04,217
and

1118
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:04,934
understanding

1119
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:05,167
how

1120
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:05,567
internal

1121
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:06,018
tooling

1122
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:06,318
worked

1123
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:06,434
at

1124
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:06,918
a company

1125
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:07,068
that

1126
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:07,485
existed

1127
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:08,719
for decades,

1128
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:08,952
and

1129
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:09,469
what

1130
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:09,736
these

1131
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:10,003
kinds

1132
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:10,086
of

1133
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:10,686
developers

1134
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:10,836
are

1135
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:11,237
asking

1136
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:11,687
questions

1137
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:12,554
about.

1138
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:12,671
And

1139
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,188
then I

1140
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:13,638
continue

1141
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:13,721

1142
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:13,905

this

00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:37,994
but

1275
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:38,228
I kind

1276
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:38,294
of

1277
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:38,478
just

1278
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:38,711
wanted

1279
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:38,978
to

1280
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:39,261
show

1281
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:40,479
you

1282
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:40,845
how

1283
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:42,146
I conceptualize

1284
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:43,697
things.

1285
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:43,880
I can

1286
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,114
also

1287
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:44,297
go

1288
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:44,747
into a

1289
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:44,931
little

1290
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:45,131
bit of

1291
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:45,281
this

1292
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:45,614
folder

1293
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:46,148
structure

1294
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:47,832
while

1295
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:47,949
it's

1296
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,249
impromptu,

1297
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:49,449
because

1298
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:49,483
I

1299
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:49,933
don't know

1300
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:50,200
if I

1301
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,717
actually

1302
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:51,067
care

1303
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:51,434
for

1304
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:51,650
this

1305
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,951
to.

1306
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:53,168
I don't

1307
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:53,268
know

1308
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:54,569
if I

1309
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:55,069
really

1310
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:55,219
want

1311
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:56,519
to

1312
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:57,220
get

1313
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,437
into

1314
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:57,620
this

1315
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:57,853
folder

1316
00:11:57,853 --> 00:11:58,270
structure

1317
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,570
because

1318
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:58,904
it's

1319
00:11:58,904 --> 00:11:59,321
such a

1320
00:11:59,321 --> 00:11:59,688
niche

1321
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:00,988
application.

1322
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,106
I think

1323
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:03,256
that

1324
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:03,406
I'm

1325
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:03,673
the only

1326
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:04,040
person

1327
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,123
who

1328
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:04,423
cares

1329
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,090
about

1330
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,374
this

1331
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:06,758
approach

1332
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:06,858
to

1333
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:07,991
projects.

1334
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:08,358
Anyway,

1335
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:08,525
I can

1336
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:08,708
use

1337
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:08,925
the

1338
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:09,426
keyboard

1339
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,326
shortcut

1340
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:10,759
command

1341
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,293
shift

1342
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:11,476
and

1343
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:12,777
then.

1344
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:15,462
The

1345
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:15,845
square

1346
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:16,929
bracket

1347
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:17,563
keys

1348
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:17,896
to

1349
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:18,313
switch

1350
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:18,697
between

1351
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,997
these.

1352
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:22,482
Other

1353
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,766
name?

1354
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,066
Yeah,

1355
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:25,633
I really

1356
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:26,150
appreciate

1357
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,233
the

1358
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:26,750
intelligent

1359
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,051
IDs.

1360
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:29,985
I find

1361
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:30,102
they're

1362
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:30,369
very

1363
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:31,002
useful

1364
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,270
for

1365
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,570
keeping

1366
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:32,686
my

1367
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:32,953
thoughts

1368
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,254
organized.

1369
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,138
Spw.

1370
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:35,538
This is

1371
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:35,988
the Spw

1372
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,289
parser.

1373
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:40,240
Library.

1374
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,457
I'm

1375
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:40,840
going

1376
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:40,940
to

1377
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,257
begin

1378
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:41,541
some

1379
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,108
work on it

1380
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,408
because

1381
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:44,075
I kind

1382
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:44,175
of

1383
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:44,742
intentionally

1384
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:45,009
left

1385
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:45,276
a bug

1386
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,093
in there

1387
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:46,626
while

1388
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:47,477
I integrated it

1389
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:47,827
into

1390
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:48,160
fact

1391
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,461
shift.com,

1392
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,395
which is

1393
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:51,996
one of them

1394
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:52,546
is

1395
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:52,963
that

1396
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:53,113
the

1397
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:53,796
labels

1398
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:54,980
on the

1399
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,447
container

1400
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:55,814
nodes

1401
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:56,448
don't

1402
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:56,898
really

1403
00:12:58,248 --> 00:12:59,049
serialize

1404
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:00,349
properly.

1405
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,717
You're,

1406
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:03,501
representing

1407
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:03,618
the

1408
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:04,068
syntax

1409
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:04,268
tree

1410
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:04,418
as

1411
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:05,685
a string.

1412
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:05,919
And

1413
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,369
another

1414
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:06,636
is

1415
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:07,636
that

1416
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:07,786
the

1417
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,087
string.

1418
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:11,321
Nodes

1419
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,305
don't

1420
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:12,639
get

1421
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,089
passed

1422
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:13,572
or

1423
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:14,256
serialized

1424
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:14,740
properly.

1425
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:14,856
I'm

1426
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:15,006
not

1427
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:15,457
entirely

1428
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:15,707
sure

1429
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:15,890
where

1430
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,057
that

1431
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:16,190
error

1432
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:16,307
is

1433
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:16,574
coming

1434
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:17,207
from.

1435
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:17,507
I think

1436
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:17,591
it's

1437
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,891
serialization

1438
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:19,192
because

1439
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:19,608
I think

1440
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:19,842
they're

1441
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:20,075
being

1442
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:20,559
joined

1443
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,126
with a

1444
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:22,426
comma

1445
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,060
instead

1446
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,377
of

1447
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:24,427
nothing.

1448
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:24,611
So

1449
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:24,728
I have

1450
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:24,828
to

1451
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:25,244
figure out

1452
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:25,428
where

1453
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:25,661
those

1454
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:25,961
errors

1455
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:26,495
are.

1456
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:26,595
And

1457
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:26,745
that's

1458
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:26,895
like

1459
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:27,245
a very

1460
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:27,879
specific

1461
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,129
thing.

1462
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:28,296
That

1463
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:28,779
probably

1464
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:28,996
means

1465
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:29,330
nothing

1466
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:29,446
to

1467
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:29,680
most

1468
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,130
people,

1469
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,730
but

1470
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:30,897
it's

1471
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:31,131
the kind

1472
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:31,181
of

1473
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:31,431
stuff

1474
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:32,414
that

1475
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:32,648
I'm

1476
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:32,931
working

1477
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,215
on.

1478
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,016
And

1479
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:35,683
that is

1480
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:36,983
a,

1481
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,417
code

1482
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:37,717
base

1483
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,000
that's

1484
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,301
two

1485
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:38,534
years

1486
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:39,218
old.

1487
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,035
Just

1488
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:40,418
cloned

1489
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:40,518
it

1490
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:41,819
today,

1491
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:42,219
so

1492
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:42,519
it'll be

1493
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,820
interesting.

1494
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:44,920
I think

1495
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,037
that

1496
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:45,471
I'm,

1497
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:45,771
I guess

1498
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:46,088
I made

1499
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:46,371
some

1500
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:46,788
changes

1501
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:48,089
recently.

1502
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:51,807
But.

1503
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,309
2023.

1504
00:13:58,277 --> 00:13:58,477
Yeah.

1505
00:13:58,477 --> 00:13:59,777
Okay.

1506
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:01,061
So for

1507
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,395
the most

1508
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:02,695
part.

1509
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:04,596
Changes

1510
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:04,730
were

1511
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,447
two years ago.

1512
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:05,647
And

1513
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:05,780
then

1514
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,080
I made

1515
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,464
a few

1516
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:07,698
changes

1517
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:08,031
towards

1518
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:08,231
the end

1519
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:08,331
of

1520
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:08,565
last

1521
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:09,649
year.

1522
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:09,765
So

1523
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:09,999
it'll be

1524
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:10,366
interesting

1525
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:10,416
to

1526
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:10,866
revisit

1527
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:11,116
that

1528
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:11,266
and

1529
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,050
see

1530
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,350
how

1531
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,600
I want

1532
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:12,667
to

1533
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:13,184
change

1534
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:13,550
it.

1535
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:15,551
And

1536
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:15,735
over

1537
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:16,635
here,

1538
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:17,085
Lord,

1539
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:17,286

00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:17,419
is

1541
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:17,652

Outland.

1543

This is the story

1544
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:19,070

1545
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,186

00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:47,817
clarity.

1605
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:48,517
Me

1606
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:48,917
talking

1607
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:49,401

00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:51,885
it's

1612
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:52,069
kind

1613
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,152

00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:52,686
a point

1615
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:52,902
where

1616
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:53,136
I can

1623
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:55,270
hey,

1624
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,520
I've

1625
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:55,937

1626
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:56,621
these.

1627
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:56,988
They all have

1628
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:57,321
different

1629
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:57,938

1630
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,338
and

1631
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:58,455

1633
00:14:58,905 --> 00:14:59,205
different

00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,339
things,

1635
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:01,390
but

1636
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:01,506
let's

1637
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:01,690
point

1638
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:01,756
to

1639
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:02,473
that

1640
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:02,740
fact

1641
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,041
shift.com

1642
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:05,925
is the

1643
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:06,109

00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:06,259
year

1645
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:06,409
old

1646
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:07,059
project

1647
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:07,993
that

1648
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:08,293
turned

1649
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:08,560
into

1650
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,077

v7.

1652
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:13,729
So I'm

1653
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:13,929
pretty

1654
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:14,296
excited

1655
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:15,313

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,980
that.

1659
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,232
Articles.

1660
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:20,599
Whenever

1661
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,516
I have

1662
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:21,699
an

1663
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,099
idea

1664
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:22,249
that

1665
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:22,450
I want

1666
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:22,550

1670
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:25,784
and

1671
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:26,018
I feel

1672
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:26,201
like

1673
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:26,418
just

1674
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:26,868
doodling

1675
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:27,218

1677
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:28,035

1678
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:28,236
come

1679
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:28,519

1681
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:29,353
publish

1682
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:30,653

Back

1684
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:33,555

1685
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:34,489
this is

1686
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:34,789

1687
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:34,939
and

1688
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:36,239
stuff,

1689
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:37,573
rust,

1690
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:38,807
server

1691
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:39,107
stuff

1692
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:39,224
like

1693
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:40,041
that.

1694
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:40,275
Front

1695
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:41,575
end.

1696
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:42,592
This is my

1697
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,659
second

1698
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:43,910
code

1699
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,210
base

1700
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,127
and

1701
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:46,244
all

1702
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:46,511
the other

1703
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,295
sites

1704
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:47,445
that

1705
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:48,395
are

1706
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,062
associated

1707
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:49,245
with

1708
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:49,429
this

1709
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,729
brand.

1710
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:52,914
Anyway,

1711
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:53,414
that

1712
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:54,348
is

1713
00:15:54,348 --> 00:15:54,548
that's

1714
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:54,831
pretty

1715
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,132
much

1716
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:55,482
the

1717
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:55,815
eight

1718
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:56,049
year

1719
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:56,415
career

1720
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,716
overview.

1721
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:58,366
Leadership

1722
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:59,667
wise.

1723
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,201
They're going

1724
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:00,351
to be

1725
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:00,801
so many

1726
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,251
different

1727
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:01,718
ways

1728
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:01,818
to

1729
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:02,018
talk

1730
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:02,235
about

1731
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:02,535
that.

1732
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:03,836
And

1733
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,120
in my

1734
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,187
experience,

1735
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:06,587
it's

1736
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:07,087
mostly

1737
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,388
political

1738
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:09,705
because

1739
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:09,905
they're

1740
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:10,239
very

1741
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,505
hands

1742
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:11,056
on and

1743
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:11,256
very

1744
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:11,539
hands

1745
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:11,806
off

1746
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,107
managers.

1747
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:13,874
Sometimes

1748
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:14,241
they

1749
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:14,841
have

1750
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,258
not

1751
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:16,058
necessarily

1752
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,359
considered,

1753
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:18,709
why

1754
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,026
they've

1755
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:19,910
chosen

1756
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,260
which

1757
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,960
style

1758
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,411
they've

1759
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:22,711
chosen.

1760
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:23,945
So

1761
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:25,246
ultimately,

1762
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,613
being

1763
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:27,797
able

1764
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:28,247
to it

1765
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:28,581
manage

1766
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:28,931
multiple

1767
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:29,414
projects

1768
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:29,498
and

1769
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:30,098
communicate

1770
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:31,065
the utility of

1771
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:31,249
them

1772
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:31,332
is

1773
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:31,599
something

1774
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:31,782
that I

1775
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:31,899
would

1776
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:32,983
hope

1777
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:33,850
is

1778
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,300
true

1779
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,667
from

1780
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:35,534
the people

1781
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:35,651
that

1782
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:36,017
I work

1783
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:36,434
with

1784
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:36,551
in

1785
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:37,035
general.

1786
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:37,185
But

1787
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:37,451
that is

1788
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:37,818
a skill

1789
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:38,135
that can be

1790
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:38,535
developed

1791
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:38,735
over

1792
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:39,769
time.

1793
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:40,636
And if

1794
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,170
it is

1795
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,671
somebody

1796
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:43,338
specific

1797
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:43,904
function

1798
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:44,121
to

1799
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:44,505
develop

1800
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:44,922
that

1801
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:45,455
amongst

1802
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:45,889
their team

1803
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:46,939
members,

1804
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:47,106
then

1805
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:47,556
they could be

1806
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:47,806
in a

1807
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:48,373
developer

1808
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,007
experience

1809
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:49,340
role.

1810
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,791
They wouldn't

1811
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,391
necessarily

1812
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:50,591
be

1813
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:51,341
a leader,

1814
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:52,008
but

1815
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:52,242
they would

1816
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:52,909
be

1817
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:53,209
kind

1818
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:53,626
of

1819
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,159
providing

1820
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,460
the fluid,

1821
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:56,760
the

1822
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,761
the lubrication

1823
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:58,211
behind

1824
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:58,695
specific

1825
00:16:58,695 --> 00:16:59,629
components.

1826
00:16:59,629 --> 00:16:59,862
So

1827
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,163
ultimately

1828
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,197
it is,

1829
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:04,814
I

1830
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:04,931
don't

1831
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:05,231
know,

1832
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:05,498
like

1833
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:06,232
recognizing

1834
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:06,348
the

1835
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:06,765
different

1836
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:07,299
strengths

1837
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:07,415
of

1838
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:07,599
each

1839
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,900
person.

1840
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,751
Etc.,

1841
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:12,901
etc.,

1842
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,185
etc..

1843
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:16,820
So

1844
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,120
what is

1845
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,620
the

1846
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,137
next

1847
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,438
step

1848
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:20,555
like?

1849
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:20,888
Honestly,

1850
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:21,339
there's

1851
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:21,889
enough

1852
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:22,489
here

1853
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:22,789
that I

1854
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,056
can

1855
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:23,440
focus

1856
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,223
on

1857
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,824
that.

1858
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:25,307
Doing

1859
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:25,841
anything

1860
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:26,691
specific

1861
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:27,075
in a

1862
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:27,675
specific

1863
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:28,625
place

1864
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,743
wouldn't

1865
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:30,126
really

1866
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:30,343
be

1867
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:30,760
clear

1868
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,060
to a

1869
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,310
lot of

1870
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,477
other

1871
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:31,760
people

1872
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,961
externally.

1873
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:34,161
So

1874
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:34,662
I can point

1875
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:34,778
to

1876
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:34,928
these

1877
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:35,412
projects

1878
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:35,529
and

1879
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:35,745
say

1880
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:35,896
that

1881
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:36,613
I'm

1882
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:37,430
actively

1883
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,846
doing

1884
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:38,113
stuff

1885
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:38,797
for them.

1886
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:39,397
But

1887
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:40,031
the important

1888
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:40,281
thing

1889
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:40,398
is

1890
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:40,481
that

1891
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:40,698
I'm

1892
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:41,415
actually

1893
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:42,015
maintaining

1894
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:42,699
relationships

1895
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:42,916
with

1896
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:43,099
eight

1897
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,199
clients,

1898
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:44,450
and

1899
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:44,683
those

1900
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:45,583
relationships

1901
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:45,817
are

1902
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:46,100
a lot

1903
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,400
more

1904
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,967
meaningful

1905
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,051
because

1906
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:48,735
they're unique.

1907
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,118
And

1908
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:49,419
how I

1909
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:49,819
actually

1910
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,119
manage

1911
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,219
those,

1912
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:51,369
how

1913
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,086
I keep tabs

1914
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:53,237
and

1915
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:53,621
what I

1916
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:54,021
think

1917
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:54,671
and

1918
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:54,938
stuff

1919
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:55,088
like

1920
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:55,371
that

1921
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:55,605
is

1922
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:55,755
more

1923
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:56,322
meaningful.

1924
00:17:57,789 --> 00:17:58,306
But I

1925
00:17:58,306 --> 00:17:58,423
would

1926
00:17:58,423 --> 00:17:58,540
have

1927
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:58,640
to

1928
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:58,873
talk

1929
00:17:58,873 --> 00:17:59,090
about

1930
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,390
that.

1931
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,891
I can

1932
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:01,041
kind

1933
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:01,124
of

1934
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:01,341
keep

1935
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:01,424
on

1936
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:01,724
talking

1937
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:01,941
about

1938
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:02,058
it,

1939
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:03,358
but

1940
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:03,609
it'll

1941
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:03,859
happen

1942
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:04,025
over

1943
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:04,659
time,

1944
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:05,509
and

1945
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:05,860
most

1946
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,193
people

1947
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:06,427
aren't

1948
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:06,710
going

1949
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,827
to

1950
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:07,761
watch

1951
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:08,744
most videos

1952
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:08,928
that I

1953
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:10,228
produce,

1954
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,346
which

1955
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:12,546
the

1956
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:12,796
idea

1957
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:12,880
with

1958
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,063
this

1959
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:13,480
video

1960
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,730
is

1961
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:13,963
that I

1962
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:14,180
would

1963
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,530
make

1964
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,164
a long

1965
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:15,948
one

1966
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:16,148
that

1967
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:16,431
I can

1968
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,382
go through,

1969
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:17,598
and

1970
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:17,865
then

1971
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:18,132
add

1972
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:18,816
timestamps

1973
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:20,116
for,

1974
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:20,683
and

1975
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,700
then

1976
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,851
transparently

1977
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,318
just

1978
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:23,718
talk

1979
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:24,585
about

1980
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:24,969
each

1981
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,269
section

1982
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,520
as if

1983
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:27,787
I'm

1984
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:28,270
saving

1985
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,970
somebody

1986
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,204
the

1987
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:29,804
watch

1988
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:30,888
for a video.

1989
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:31,222
So

1990
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:31,605
I would make

1991
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:32,355
a Tldr

1992
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:32,505
for

1993
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:33,606
this

1994
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:34,090
seemingly

1995
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,356
20

1996
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:34,640
minute

1997
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,940
video.

1998
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:37,341
Maybe

1999
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:37,424
I'll

2000
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:37,641
make

2001
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:37,725
an

2002
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:38,292
intro

2003
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:38,525
for

2004
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:38,858
this

2005
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,159
video

2006
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,460
with

2007
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,010
the timestamps,

2008
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:43,994
then

2009
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:44,895
upload

2010
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:45,161
the

2011
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,462
subtitles

2012
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:47,563
after

2013
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:48,163
processing

2014
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:48,430
it in

2015
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,730
premiere

2016
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,030
and

2017
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,681
mention

2018
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:51,281
how long

2019
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:51,398
it

2020
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:51,765
takes

2021
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:52,098
for me

2022
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:52,431
to

2023
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,015
process

2024
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:53,382
one

2025
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,432
video,

2026
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:54,816
because

2027
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:55,033
right

2028
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:55,249
now

2029
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:55,783
this is

2030
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:57,701
560MB

2031
00:18:58,218 --> 00:18:58,951
at 19

2032
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,235
minutes,

2033
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:00,369
have

2034
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:00,569
only

2035
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:01,686
65MB.

2036
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:06,021
So

2037
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:06,621
I can

2038
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:06,888
kind

2039
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:07,005
of

2040
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:07,338
guess

2041
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:07,505
how

2042
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:08,806
long.

2043
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:09,790
Yeah,

2044
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,156
I can

2045
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:10,657
kind of

2046
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:11,440
guess

2047
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,657
how

2048
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:11,857
long

2049
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:12,041
this

2050
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:12,191
is

2051
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:12,408
going

2052
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:12,491
to

2053
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:12,741
take

2054
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,025
to process.

2055
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:15,426
And

2056
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:16,009
it wouldn't

2057
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:16,626
necessarily

2058
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:16,776
be

2059
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:17,660
meaningful

2060
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,260
because

2061
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,561
it

2062
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:20,028
is the

2063
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:20,511
first time

2064
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:20,661
that

2065
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,245
I'm

2066
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:21,729
making

2067
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:22,029
this

2068
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:22,429
kind

2069
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:22,696
of

2070
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:23,996
content.

2071
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,597
I

2072
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:24,947
notice

2073
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:25,214
that

2074
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:25,580
when I

2075
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,414
predict

2076
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:26,748
I make

2077
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,164
predictions

2078
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:27,381
about

2079
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:28,298
videos,

2080
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:28,415
it

2081
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:28,632
really

2082
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:28,849
does

2083
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:29,232
depend

2084
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:29,716
on how

2085
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:30,216
many times

2086
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:30,733
I change

2087
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:30,850
the

2088
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,867
screen.

2089
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:32,083
And

2090
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:32,300
that's

2091
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,567
kind

2092
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:32,650
of

2093
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:32,901
hard

2094
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:33,167
for me

2095
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:33,284
to

2096
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:33,501
make

2097
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:33,801
essays

2098
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:34,551
on

2099
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:34,868
file

2100
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:36,019
size

2101
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:36,319
and

2102
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,886
exporting

2103
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:37,186
this.

2104
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:37,336
I

2105
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:37,603
do have

2106
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:38,903
some

2107
00:19:38,987 --> 00:19:39,487
some

2108
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:40,121
ideas

2109
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:40,271
for

2110
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:40,521
how to

2111
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:40,721
make

2112
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:40,971
that

2113
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,438
process

2114
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:42,738
faster.

2115
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,807
And

2116
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:47,407
maybe

2117
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:47,691
I

2118
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:47,841
am

2119
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:48,158
just

2120
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:48,558
going

2121
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:49,858
to

2122
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:50,409
upload

2123
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:50,559
the

2124
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,009
audio

2125
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:51,159
to

2126
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:51,409
this

2127
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:52,710
separately

2128
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:53,377
on

2129
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:54,261
my website,

2130
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:54,461
and

2131
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:54,611
then

2132
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,278
synchronize

2133
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:55,394
it

2134
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,695
somehow.

2135
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:57,495
We'll

2136
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,596
see

2137
00:19:58,596 --> 00:19:59,079
anyway.

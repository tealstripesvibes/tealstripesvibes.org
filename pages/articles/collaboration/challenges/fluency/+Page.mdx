    # Mismatched Fluency

    ## in Team Contexts

    ### It's not all bad

    Teams can greatly benefit from blended skills and generational expertise.

    ### When fluency differences become noticeable

    Sometimes opportunity depends on timing, and in those moments, precise movement towards
    specific forms of production might be the difference between short- and long-term success.

    If the goal is to maintain [timeliness](/articles/collaboration/strategies/timing),
    it might not be prudent to spend the moment attempting to synchronize deep understanding.

    There is a fair bit of nuance, here, though.

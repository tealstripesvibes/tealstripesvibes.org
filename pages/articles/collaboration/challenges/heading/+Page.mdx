    # Mismatched Heading

    ## in Team Contexts

    When team members have misaligned goals, internal friction can slow progress.

    ### It's not all bad

    It's normal for a diverse set of perspectives to approach similar spaces from different conceptual bases.

    This is good and okay!

    Diverse perspectives can save a team from unique roadblocks.

    When your team has expansive experiences,
    they are more prepared to tackle expansive problems.

    Over time in any collaborative relationship, clutter fills corners that are not actively swept.

    ## An Allegory

    [The Clown Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1B53t7YOTM&list=PLMCJGH96K0IQIHELp7ie_Bef0ZIUqCoVE&index=8)
    is media.

    It has size and order.

    We can modify its [form](/articles/design/language/) and [presentation](/articles/design/presentation/) to match our
    needs.

    This might have consequences.

    ## Origin

    I used [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) to create the Clown Animation.

    Procreate is nice because of how it cohesively fits into the Apple Pencil user experience.

    There are a lot of ways to gain [meaningful fluency](/articles/design/language/) while exploring Procreate, and I've
    found
    [animation](/articles/design/motion/) to be a good excuse to learn more.

    ## Size

    The exported filesize of The Clown Animation varies *wildly* based on how it's handled.

    | Format Extension | File Size | Format Name |
    | --- | --- | -- |
    | .PSD | 95.9<span className="unit">MB</span> | PhotoShop Document |
    | .PDF (layers) | 187.4<span className="unit">MB</span> | Portable Document Format |
    | .PDF (image) | 1.4<span className="unit">MB</span> | Portable Document Format |
    | .MP4 | 40.5<span className="unit">MB</span> | MPEG-4 |
    | .HEVC | 30.6<span className="unit">MB</span> | High Efficiency Video Coding |
    | .GIF | 15<span className="unit">MB</span> | Graphics Interchange Format |
    | .PNG (layers) | ~30<span className="unit">MB</span> | Portable Network Graphics |
    | .PNG (image) | 587<span className="unit">KB</span> | Portable Network Graphics |


    ### PDFs
    The largest file size came from exporting the file as a PDF with layers.

    This is not unusual; PDFs make relatively few assumptions about the content they contain.

    The reason for this is that the PDF format is designed to be a container for a variety of content types, and it's
    not optimized for any one of them.

    Therefore, compression is not a priority in the PDF format.

    ### PNGs
    Exporting the image as PNG files invoked network conditions as a point of workflow friction.

    While it is something I've done before, the number of files and the context of their handling made it a bit of a
    pain to manage this time.

    In checking the filetype file sizes for this article,
    not all of the PNGs were successfully transferred from my iPad to the cloud to my computer.

    As I uploaded the images to the cloud, the aggregate data size and the number of items in the batch caused a
    processing error, and I ended up with a partial download of 270/342 images.

    The network failure wasn't because of the file size or format here, but the number of files and the context of their
    handling.

    Because each layer was exported as a separate PNG file, this 342 frame animation stretched the limits of my
    bandwidth with an files that were only ~65KB on average.

    Perhaps if I were using a <a href="#for__a-different-device">different device</a>,
    <a href="#for__a-different-application">different application</a>,
    or <a href="#for__a-different-location">different location</a>, this wouldn't
    have been an issue.

    A <a id="for__a-different-device" href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Device-Keith-Thomas-LaSpaluto/dp/B08MW984KP">different device</a> might handle network connections differently by
    default.
    Power settings might be different, or the device might have a different network card.

    As a developer, I need to be mindful to consider my own devices with a grain of salt as they can be quite different
    than what my audience is using.

    A <a id="for__a-different-application" href="https://factshift.com">different application</a>
    might spawn a lower number of more
    reliable connections, or it might have a more robust error handling system.

    The application I used uploaded the files one-by-one, and it didn't have a way to resume the upload after the
    partial network failure.

    A <a id="for__a-different-location" href="https://in.bane.land">different location</a> might have a more reliable network connection.

<main>

    # Section

    This HTML element represents generic sectioning intent.

    ## Usage notes

    Most of the time, sections should be associated with some heading.

    Consider the semantic intent of content;
    there may be a more fitting element to use,
    such as an article or aside element.

  </article>
</main>

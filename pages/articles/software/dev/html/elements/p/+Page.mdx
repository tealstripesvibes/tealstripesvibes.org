    # P

    This HTML element represents a paragraph.

    Paragraphs can be identified by screen readers and are typically useful for
    conveying the meaning of an article, section, or page.

    Typically, paragraphs contain text and links,
    though they can also contain images, lists, and other elements.

    ## Usage notes

    Because these elements are meaningful to screen readers, it is important to
    only use them when there it is semantically necessary to do so.

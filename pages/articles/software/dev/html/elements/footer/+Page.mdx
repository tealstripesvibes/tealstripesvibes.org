    # Footer

    This HTML element is used to contain footer content for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.

    ## Common contents

    - about the author
    - copyright information
    - related documents

    ## Usage notes

    You can use the address element to enclose relevant information about the author.

    The footer is not sectioning content and will not create a new section in the outline.

    This element can be used multiple times in a document,
    though when it is anchored to the HTML body,
    it represents the footer of the entire page.

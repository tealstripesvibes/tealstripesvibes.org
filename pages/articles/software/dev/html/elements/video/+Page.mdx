    ## Usage notes

    Not all browsers support all video formats;
    use source elements to offer options and fallbacks.
    The browser will choose the first one it understands.

    You can use the object-position property to adjust the position of the video within the element's frame.

    You can use the object-fit property to control how the video is resized to fit the frame.

    Subtitles and captions can be added with the track element.


    ## Accessibility concerns

    Videos should provide both captions and transcripts.

    # How I'm Looking for a Job


    ## Code

    This code copies the URLs of all the job listings I've saved on LinkedIn into an array.
    <code>{`var arr  = arr || [];
arr.push(
  ...new Set(
    [...document.querySelectorAll('a')]
      .filter(
        a => a.href.indexOf('flagship3_job_home_savedjobs') > -1).map(a => a.href.split('?')[0]
      )
  )
)`}</code>

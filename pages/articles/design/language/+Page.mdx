    # Design Language

    ## Purpose

    Design always involves language.

    Language represents ideas.

    Design solidifies ideas by bending reality into convergent forms.

    ## Fluency

    Fluency is the ability to represent and understand ideas.

    In design, it can be useful to imagine Fluency as a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current) that flows from intent.

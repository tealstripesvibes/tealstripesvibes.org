(Main Features) {
    Feature Flags:
		which cluster of intent
			(to know what we are building)
			    [
			        clear feature identities make it easier to communicate across teams about which things change
			    ]
    Form Handling:
		which process of engagement
			(to know how others interact)
			    [
			        simple channels for collecting input can help reduce complexity in the short and long term
			    ]
    GraphQL:
		which shape of exchange
			(to remain internally and externally cohesive)
			    [
			        build a bridge to maintain structure across contexts
			    ]
    User Authentication:
		which form of identity
			(to recognize engagement)
			    [
			        form structures that facilitate the development of identity
			    ]
}

(Third-party Libraries) {
    TypeScript:
		which shape is the code
			(to make quality code more accessible)
			    [
		            reduce the vectors where bugs may be introduced
			    ]
    React:
		how should things flow
			(to have a rhythm about development)
			    [
			        choose an ecosystem that enables iterative development
			    ]
    Redux:
		how is state managed
			(to relate to how the application changes)
			    [
			        manage state changes with common language
			    ]
    GraphQL:
		how are queries identified
			(to synchronize the frontend and the backend)
			    [
			        mind communication as a bottleneck
			    ]
    Apollo:
		how do we communicate
			(to funnel the options into more discrete channels)
			    [
			        select tooling that supports your development pace
			    ]
    Cypress:
		how is behavior verified
			(to be confident about which changes are happening)
			    [
			        maintain velocity by monitoring impact
			    ]
    Storybook:
		what is the visual language
			(to synchronize design and development)
			    [
			        communicate across teams to simplify how ideas are referenced
			    ]

			        exploring imagination

		what are the constraints
			(to limit the noise)
			    [
			        grounding abstraction

		what defines the form
			(to add structure)

		how does it work
			(to introduce resilience)
			    [
			        maintaining consistency
